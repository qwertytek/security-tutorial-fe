# Astro Starter

A project designed with essential functionalities to kickstart development effectively using Astro + React.
This project is intended to be connected to a back end application, as it should not deal with authentication, authorization and direct connection to a database. It is intended to be only served as front end application, focusing on SSR for fast initial page loads and SEO optimization, while serving client side rendering for interactive web applications. Combining the best of both worlds.

What it currently includes:

- Astro for SSR
- React for client side rendering
- Eslint
- Base layout component for global styles
- Login for form submission to api (internal route)
